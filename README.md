# Solar System Simulation

A basic solar system simulation created with **three.js** and **TypeScript**, providing a fun and interactive way to explore a stylized solar system with cartoonish elements. This project visually emphasizes planet differences in speed, size, and distance from the Sun for a unique, easy-to-understand experience.

## Features

- **Planetary Orbits**: Each planet orbits the Sun at different speeds and distances.
- **Distinct Properties**: Planets have noticeable differences in radius, orbit speed, and spacing.
- **Interactive Camera Controls**: Use the mouse to pan, zoom, and rotate around the solar system.
- **Planet Labels**: Each planet displays its name without needing to hover over it.

## Technologies Used

- **three.js**: For 3D rendering and animation.
- **TypeScript**: For enhanced readability and type-checking.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalpawar26/solar-system.git
   cd solar-system
   ```

2. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```base
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the simulation.

## Future Improvements

- Add rings, moons, and other distinguishing features to planets.
- Introduce comets and dwarf planets to enrich the simulation.
- Improve visuals with more realistic textures and advanced lighting effects.
- Implement precise orbital mechanics for enhanced realism.
- Enable real-time tracking of positions and rotations for planets, comets, and dwarf planets.
